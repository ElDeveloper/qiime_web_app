Selecting Sequences
-------------------
Users have the ability to select sequences by clicking on the textbox next to each sequence, however for alignments with numerous sequence, the user may want to select all, none, or the inverse of what is already selected. To quickly select sequences, the user can use the Select Sequences option under the Sequences Tab.

Show/Hide Sequences
-----------------------
Based on which sequences are selected, the user has the ability to show/hide sequences, which is a way to vertically collapse the alignment, by selecting show/hide from the Show/Hide Sequences option under the Sequences Tab.

Pad Sequences
-----------------------
In the event the user inserts/deletes cells from the alignment, the lengths of each sequence may vary.  The user has the ability to pad all sequences with "-" by clicking on the Pad Sequences button under the Sequences Tab.  

.. note::
    
    By default, all sequences are padded when output to a new window or when downloaded.
