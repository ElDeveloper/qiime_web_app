QIIME Tutorials
===================
The QIIME tutorials are documents that illustrate how to use various features of the QIIME. We recommend that all users begin with the `Create Study and Generate MIMARKS-compliant Metadata <./tutorial.html>`_ which takes the user through a full analysis of sequencing data. After you've begun analyzing your own data, you'll want to move on to the special-purpose tutorials as needed.

Boulder ALE Tutorial
======================
The Boulder ALE tutorial illustrates an analysis of a tRNA alignment, where the basepair list was taken from the `FR3D <http://rna.bgsu.edu/FR3D>`_ website and the feature list was manually generated based on visual inspection of the 3D x-ray crystal structure of `PDB:1N77 <http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?pdbId=1N77>`_.
