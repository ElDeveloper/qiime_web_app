jqChart jQuery Plugin

===========================
Installlation
===========================

Download and unzip the contents of the archive to any convenient location. The package contains the following folders:

- [js] - The javascript files of jqChart (and the needed libraries). You need to include them in your HTML page, in order to gain the client side functionality of the chart. 
The first file is "jquery-1.5.1.min.js" - this is the official jQuery library on which jqChart is built upon.
The second file you need is the "excanvas.js" javascript file. It is used from the versions of IE, which dosn't support canvas graphics.
The last one is the jqChart javascript code itself, located in "jquery.jqChart.min.js"

- [css] - Contains the Css file that the jqChart needs. 

- [samples] - Contains some examples that use the jqChart. For full list of samples plese visit - www.jqchart.com/samples

The final result you will have in a HTML page containing jqChart would be something similar to that:
