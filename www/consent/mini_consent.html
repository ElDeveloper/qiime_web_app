    <b>Your participation in this research study is voluntary.</b> Please think about the information below carefully. Feel free to ask questions before making your decision whether or not to participate. If you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign this form electronically and will receive a copy of the form by email at the address you supplied when you signed up for the study.

    <li><h4>Purpose and Background</h4>
        <p> Trillions of microorganisms live on and within the human body, which is colonized at birth and continuously inhabited throughout a personâ€™s lifetime. Our resident microbes occupy many body habitats, including the skin and mucosal surfaces, and the gastrointestinal tract. Our microbial symbionts are largely harmless or beneficial; for example, we rely on our gut microbiota to aid in nutrition, resist pathogens, and educate our immune system.  We would like to survey a large number of US residents from across the country including all body types, all dietary preferences and both healthy and unhealthy people to more clearly define the range of these microbial communities.  We are interested in learning whether people with similar age, diet, environment, family, pets, body weight, or other features, also have similar microorganisms.  To accomplish this we will ask you to sample 3 sites on your body (skin, saliva and stool) using polyester tipped swabs that will be sent to you at the address you provide with a questionnaire and a prepaid FedEx envelope that you will use to return the samples to us. You will also be asked to complete a questionnaire that includes questions about age, diet, environment, family, pets, body weight and current health status.  You will be asked to use a website to determine your average intake of fat, protein, carbohydrates, vegetables and grains.  The samples will have a code label attached to them so that we can identify who sent them to us but no personally identifying information.  The samples will be returned to us with the completed questionnaire in a prepaid FedEx envelope.  Some people will be asked to keep a food diary detailing everything they eat and drink everyday for up to 6 months.  We may also request additional skin, saliva and stool samples from certain participants that are of particular interest because of their health status and/or dietary preferences (a maximum of 4 times).  We anticipate that the study will be completed in 5 years.  At the end of the study we will provide you with an easy to understand summary of the microbial communities of your body and a summary of the combined results of other participants for comparison

    <li><h4>Study Tasks and Procedures</h4>
        <p>To be considered for the study we ask that you provide us with the following information: name, age, sex, e-mail address for all correspondence related to the study and your home address.  This information will be used to determine your eligibility for the study.  If you are eligible for the study you will be informed by email (within 2 weeks of submitting this form) and assigned a code.  The information you provide will be assigned to this code.  You will use the code to complete your electronic signature when you sign the Main Consent to take part in the study.  If you are not eligible for the study we will advise you by email and your information will be deleted electronically.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Duration</h4>
        <p>You will enter this information on-line and we anticipate that it will take less than 10 minutes.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Study Withdrawal</h4>
        <p>Providing us with this information is <b>voluntary</b>.  You do not have to participate if you don't want to.  You may also choose to withdraw your information.  If you choose to withdraw we will delete the electronic record of any information you have provided except for the email address you used to request that you be enrolled in the study and dietary preference information. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Risks and Discomforts</h4>
        <p>There are no foreseeable risks for participating in this study.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Benefits</h4>
        <p>You may not receive any direct benefit from taking part in this study other than your intrinsic interest in the scientific outcome.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Confidentiality</h4>
        <p>We will make every effort to maintain the privacy of the data you provide. All data will transferred electronically to a secure database stored on a server (the beast) in a CU card access-controlled server room. There is no public accessibility to this server without VPN and a password. The information will be assigned to a code that will be used as part of your electronic signature. The code key will be kept in a locked cabinet separate from the data.  Following the conclusion of the study we will destroy the hard copies via shredding and recycling.  All other data including all electronic data will be de-identified (coded). </p>
        <p>These are some reasons that we may need to share the information you give us with others:
        </p>
        <ul>
