<h2>Sequencing &amp; Results</h2>
<p class="portal_blurb">
Once you have added a <a href="#" onclick="selectTab('source')">sample source, completed the relevant survey</a> (if applicable), <a href="#" onclick="selectTab('sample')">taken</a> and <a href="#" onclick="selectTab('log')">logged your samples</a> and you have <a href="#" onclick="selectTab('mail')">mailed the samples back to us</a>, we will then perform sequencing and analysis on your samples.

<p class="portal_blurb">
Sequencing and data analysis can take up to 6 months, please be patient! We will let you know as soon as your samples have been sequenced and analyzed.
