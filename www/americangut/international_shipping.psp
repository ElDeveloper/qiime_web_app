                        <h3>International Participants:</h3>
                        <p>In order to comply with amended federal and IATA regulations, we are requesting that international participants return their sample tubes through FedEx International and that international participants follow the additional safely requirements for shipping human swab samples to the United States. You will need to use the provided airway bill for shipment, and it must clearly identify the package as containing "human exempt specimens". The samples will additionally need to be packaged within a secondary containment to ensure that they can safely enter the United States.
<br />
<br />
For shipment, you will need to use regular tape to seal the plastic tube that contains the swab, then place the swab in the provided brown mailing envelope and place the brown envelope inside a Tyvek/plastic mailer, <strong>which can be acquired free of charge from FedEx</strong>, when shipping the package, prior to FedEx shipment.
<br />
<br />
If you do not follow these directions the sample will be destroyed by United States Customs at the port of entry into the United States.</p>
